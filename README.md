- 👋 Hi, I’m @ARTOFSILENCE-AI
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D modeling for art, sculpture, and architecture... overall target an understanding of the USD/Omniverse architecture and finding the modeling tools 
most useful to those directions. I have an extensive background in the visual arts incluing painting, art glass, and constructive sculpture. I invented the painting style known as hard-edge impressionism and the photo transformation style known as repainted photography. I was likely the first glass artist to employ three dimensional illusions in the glass picture plane, techniques which I published in the 1970s in magazines such as Art Glass and Glass Studio. Portfolio link on request.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the scene editor in 3DXChat, which I understand uses a (very) few of the model shaping conventions from Unity and other USD editors. It feels like a blunt instrument.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... ask me later.
